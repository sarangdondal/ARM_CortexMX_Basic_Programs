# ARM_CortexMX_Basic_Programs
This repository includes basic programming of ARM Cortex Mx processors.

All these programs are written for STM NUCLEO BOARD F446RE and STM DISCOVERY BOARD STM32F407G-DISC1.
You are free to use any above boards but 'task scheduler' program is specific for STM DISCOVERY BOARD STM32F407G-DISC1.
If you want to use it for STM NUCLEO BOARD F446RE,then you have to do changes according to the board.

I have used STM32 CUBE IDE.

For running, just download, open STM32 CUBE IDE and make workspace .
click 'open projects from file system' and in import source enter your directory where
you download these projects.Connect your board build and debug.
